What is TypeScript?
- TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on javascript.
- TypeScript developed and maintained by microsoft.
- TypeScript is javascript with types.
- TypeScript and features to javascript without changing it.

Why we need TypeScript?
- Detect errors without running the code "Static type checking"
- Analyze the code as you type
- Save some unit test as the error show while writing
- Every JS file is valid TS file
- Will help you when you write React, Vue, Angular Apps
- Gives you the missing features in JS like "Interfaces, Generics, Decorators"

How TypeScript works?
- TypeScript compiler compile TS code into JavaScript code "This called Transpilation"
- How about the new features? workaround

What you need to know?
- JavaScript Concepts
-- Variables
-- Arrays
-- Objects
-- Functions
-- Conditions

How you can use TypeScript?
[1] - Install Nodejs
[2] - Be Nodejs its installed "Check from terminal" node
[3] - Install TypeScript
[4] - Be TypeScript its installed "ckeck from terminal" tsc
[5] - Create TS file
[6] - Compile JS file
[7] - Check TS Playground

Statically vs Dynamically Typed Languages

Statically Typed Language Like [Rust, C, C++]
- Variables Types are static, once you declare it you cannot change
- Type of a variable is known at compile time "do type checking at compile-time"
--- Have better performance at run-time due to not needing to check types Dynamically
- Error Detected Earlier

Dynamically Typed Language Like [PHP, Python, JavaScript]
- Variables types are dynamic, you can always change it
- "Type checking at ececution-time"
- Error can be detected after execution

Type Annotations || Signature
-- Indicate the data type of Variables
-- Indicate the data type of functions input/output
-- Objects, etc.

- Why we use it?
- Is it mandatory?
- Waht happen if we didn't use it?

Type Annotations with functions

- noImplicitAny

- noImplicitReturns
--- Will Check All Code Paths In a function to ensure they return a value

- noUnusedLocals
--- Report errors on unused local variables

- noUnusedParameters
--- Report errors on unused parameters in function.
